## Compliance and Enforcement

### Self-Reporting

Organizations that exceed the free-tier thresholds must:
1. **Self-report** within 30 days of exceeding limits
2. **Obtain** appropriate commercial license
3. **Maintain** compliance documentation

### Audits

DEFAI reserves the right to:
- Request usage documentation (with reasonable notice)
- Conduct compliance audits (annually for enterprise users)
- Verify revenue/funding information via public sources

### Violations

Unlicensed commercial use may result in:
- **License termination** (immediate)
- **Legal action** for damages (back-licensing fees + penalties)
- **Injunctive relief** (cease-and-desist)
- **Public disclosure** of violation (for competitive use)

---

## Model Weights and Future AI Components

### Current Status (v8.3.1+)

**AutomatosX does NOT currently include**:
- Pre-trained model weights
- Learned routing policies (uses code-based policies)
- Embedding models (uses SQLite FTS5 for search)
- Neural network parameters

**Current licensing**: Apache 2.0 for all code. No separate model licensing needed.

### Future: If Models Are Added

If future versions of AutomatosX include **pre-trained models or trained weights**, those components will be **separately licensed** under **OpenRAIL-M** (Responsible AI License - Model) or similar responsible AI licensing terms.

**Why separate licensing for models**:
- Code (Apache 2.0): Permissive software license
- Models (OpenRAIL-M): Responsible AI use restrictions

**OpenRAIL-M Key Principles** (if applicable):
1. **Open access**: Models can be used, modified, and shared
2. **Responsible use**: Restrictions on harmful applications
3. **Downstream responsibility**: Users must pass on use restrictions

**Prohibited Uses** (if models included):
- Generating harmful, misleading, or illegal content
- Creating deepfakes or non-consensual content
- Surveillance or privacy violations
- Discrimination or bias amplification
- Malicious code generation
- Weaponization or harm to individuals

**Current Action Required**: **None** - no models in current version.

**If models added**: This document will be updated with specific OpenRAIL-M terms and model-specific restrictions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: I'm a solo developer making $0 revenue. Do I need a license?
**A**: No. Personal use is always free.

### Q: My startup has $1.5M revenue and $500K funding. Do I need a license?
**A**: No, as long as you're under $2M revenue **AND** $2M funding.

### Q: We raised $3M in funding but have $0 revenue. Need a license?
**A**: Yes. You exceed the $2M funding threshold.

### Q: Can I use AutomatosX internally at my $10M company?
**A**: Yes, but you need a commercial license (exceed $2M revenue threshold).

### Q: Can I build a competing AI orchestration platform?
**A**: Not without a commercial license. Competitive use requires special licensing.

### Q: Can I offer AutomatosX as a SaaS?
**A**: Not without a commercial license, regardless of your revenue.

### Q: I'm a university researcher. Is this free?
**A**: Yes. Research and academic use is always free, no revenue limits.

### Q: Can I modify the code?
**A**: Yes. Apache 2.0 allows modifications. But commercial use restrictions still apply to modified versions.

### Q: What if I contribute code back?
**A**: Contributions are welcome! Apache 2.0 governs contributions. You grant DEFAI rights to use your contribution, but you retain copyright. We may require a CLA (Contributor License Agreement) for significant contributions.

### Q: What about OpenRAIL-M? Does it apply to me?
**A**: Not currently. AutomatosX v8.3.1+ contains NO models, so OpenRAIL-M does not apply. If future versions include models, those will be separately licensed.

### Q: Can I use AutomatosX in a closed-source product?
**A**: Yes (Apache 2.0 allows this), BUT:
- If your company ≥ $2M revenue/funding → commercial license required
- If offering as SaaS → commercial license required
- You must still include Apache 2.0 license text and attribution

### Academic → Commercial

Transitioning research to commercial product:

1. **Contact us** when commercialization begins (before revenue)
2. **Separate pricing** for research spinouts (academic discount)
3. **Founders' discount** programs available (up to 50% off first year)
4. **Deferred payment** options (pay after first revenue milestone)

## Legal

### Relationship to Apache 2.0

This document **supplements**, but does **not replace**, the Apache License 2.0 (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).

**In case of conflict**:
1. Apache 2.0 governs **code licensing** (use, modify, distribute)
2. This document governs **commercial use restrictions** (who can use commercially)
3. **Both must be satisfied** for lawful use

**Example**: You can modify the code (Apache 2.0 permits), but if you're a $10M company, you still need a commercial license to use it.

### Governing Law

**Jurisdiction**: Laws of Singapore

**Dispute Resolution**: Arbitration in Singapore under SIAC (Singapore International Arbitration Centre) rules

**Language**: English

### Severability

If any provision of this license is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force.

### Entire Agreement

This document, together with the Apache License 2.0, constitutes the entire agreement for use of AutomatosX.

---

**Last Updated**: January 2025

**Version**: 2.0 (Simplified - Removed active OpenRAIL-M clauses)

**Effective Date**: Retroactive to all versions since v8.0.0

**Change from v1.0**: Clarified that OpenRAIL-M is only for future models (not currently applicable). Simplified structure for software-only licensing.
