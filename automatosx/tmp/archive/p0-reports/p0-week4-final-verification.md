## Recommendations for Sprint 3

### Documentation Maintenance

1. ✅ Continue daily execution outcome pattern (proven effective in Sprint 2)
2. ✅ Maintain comprehensive detail (500-900 lines per day)
3. ✅ Update Sprint 3 completion summary at sprint end
4. ✅ Create Sprint 4 kickoff plan at Sprint 3 end

### Process Improvements (From Sprint 2 Retrospective)

1. ✅ Prepare Sprint 3 demo script by Day 8 (not Day 9)
2. ✅ Allocate Days 8-9 for exploratory testing (QA focus)
3. ✅ Create documentation concurrently with implementation
4. ✅ Schedule knowledge sharing sessions (incremental indexing completed Day 1)
5. ✅ Evaluate 2-week sprint cadence in Sprint 3 retrospective

### Quality Standards

- Maintain all 4 quality gates above targets (Coverage ≥90%, Pass Rate ≥95%, Variance ±5%, Defect Density <0.5/pt)
- Continue zero-incident deployment discipline
- Sustain 100% documentation completeness for Sprint 3
