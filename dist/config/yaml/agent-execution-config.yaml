# REFACTORING #19: Agent Execution Configuration
# Configuration for AgentBase retry logic, timeouts, and backoff behavior
# Controls execution resilience and failure handling

version: "1.0"

# Maximum number of retry attempts for failed tasks
# Range: 1-10
# Higher values = more resilient to transient failures
# Lower values = faster failure detection
maxRetries: 3

# Task execution timeout in milliseconds (5 minutes)
# Range: 30000-600000 (30 seconds to 10 minutes)
# Adjust based on expected task complexity
timeoutMs: 300000

# Exponential backoff configuration
backoff:
  # Base delay in milliseconds for first retry
  # Range: 100-5000
  baseMs: 1000

  # Maximum delay cap in milliseconds
  # Range: 5000-60000 (5 seconds to 1 minute)
  # Prevents excessive wait times on later retries
  maxMs: 10000

  # Backoff multiplier (exponential growth factor)
  # Formula: delay = min(baseMs * (multiplier ^ attempt), maxMs)
  # Default: 2 (doubles each retry)
  multiplier: 2

# Error handling configuration
errors:
  # Whether to log detailed error traces
  logTraces: true

  # Whether to emit error events for monitoring
  emitEvents: true
