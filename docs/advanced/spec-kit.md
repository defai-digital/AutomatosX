# Spec-Kit (Advanced) — v12.7.x

This file is a short pointer to the current Spec-Kit guide. Policy-based routing and free-tier optimization are not supported in v12.7.x.

See: `docs/guides/spec-kit-guide.md` for up-to-date usage. Control providers via priorities in `ax.config.json`; omit `policy` blocks.
