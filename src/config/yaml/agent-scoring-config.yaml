# REFACTORING #18: Agent Scoring Configuration
# Configuration for AgentBase capability scoring algorithm
# Controls how agents are matched to tasks

version: "1.0"

# Minimum score required for an agent to be considered capable of handling a task
# Range: 0.0 to 1.0
# Lower values = more permissive (agents handle more diverse tasks)
# Higher values = more restrictive (agents only handle specific tasks)
minCapabilityScore: 0.3

# Weight assigned when a keyword from agent capabilities matches the task description
# Higher values give more importance to keyword matches
keywordMatchWeight: 1

# Weight assigned when a specialization from agent matches the task description
# Higher values give more importance to specialization matches
# Should be >= keywordMatchWeight since specializations are more specific
specializationMatchWeight: 2

# Divisor used to normalize the raw score to 0-1 range
# Larger values = stricter normalization (harder to reach high scores)
# Smaller values = looser normalization (easier to reach high scores)
scoreNormalizationDivisor: 10
