## Recommendations for Week 4+

### Documentation Maintenance
1. ✅ Week 4 execution plan already created - ready for use
2. Continue daily execution outcome documentation pattern (proven effective)
3. Maintain supporting document creation as needed (checklists, technical specs)
4. Update handoff documents at week boundaries

### Process Improvements
1. Implement action item tracker dashboard (AI-W3D1-09) - high priority
2. Apply dependency flagging in sprint planning (AI-W3D1-06)
3. Schedule demo script stakeholder review early (AI-W3D1-07)
4. Complete Tree-sitter Rust integration (60% → 100%)
5. Accept remaining Sprint 2 stories (TaskRunner, Incremental Indexing)

### Quality Standards
- Maintain all 4 quality gates above targets (Coverage ≥90%, Pass Rate ≥95%, Variance ±5%, Defect Density <0.5/pt)
- Continue zero-incident deployment discipline
- Sustain 100% documentation completeness for future weeks
