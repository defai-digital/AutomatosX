## Recommendations for Sprint 4

### Documentation Maintenance

1. ✅ Create Sprint 4 kickoff plan (NEXT STEP)
2. ✅ Continue consolidated execution summary approach (proven efficient for Sprint 3)
3. ✅ Maintain comprehensive detail (10,000-12,000 lines per sprint)
4. ✅ Create Sprint 5 kickoff plan at Sprint 4 end

### Process Improvements (From Sprint 3 Retrospective)

1. ✅ Continue demo prep Day 8 (proven effective in Sprint 3)
2. ✅ Continue exploratory testing Days 8-9 (proven effective in Sprint 3)
3. ✅ Continue documentation concurrency (proven effective in Sprint 3)
4. ✅ Add internal beta testing phase: 5 users, 2 days before external release
5. ✅ Send beta user survey on Day 8 (vs Day 10) for more response time
6. ✅ Consider "office hours" for beta users: 2x per week scheduled support

### Quality Standards

- Maintain all 4 quality gates above targets (Coverage ≥90%, Pass Rate ≥95%, Variance ±5%, Defect Density <0.5/pt)
- Continue zero-incident deployment discipline (three consecutive sprints)
- Sustain 100% documentation completeness for Sprint 4

### Production Pilot (Sprint 4 Priority)

- Execute 5% traffic rollout in Sprint 4 Week 1 (Days 1-5)
- Monitor variance, incidents, user feedback closely
- Rollback plan ready (<5 min execution)
- Success criteria: Variance ≤±5%, zero critical incidents, positive user feedback
