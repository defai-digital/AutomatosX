## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need a commercial license to use AutomatosX?

**A**: **No**, not if you're using the **Open Source Edition** from GitHub. That's free forever under Apache 2.0.

You only need a commercial license if you:
- ✅ Want additional features in Pro/Enterprise editions
- ✅ Need priority support and guaranteed SLAs
- ✅ Require LTS for production stability
- ✅ Need compliance features (SSO, audit logs, SIEM)

### Q: Can I use Open Source Edition in my commercial product?

**A**: **Yes**, absolutely! Apache License 2.0 allows commercial use, modification, and redistribution. You don't owe us anything, and there are no revenue limits.

### Q: What's the difference between this and the old COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md?

**A**: The old version (v2.0) included confusing references to revenue thresholds ($2M+) and OpenRAIL-M model licensing. **We've simplified**:

- ✅ **Open Source = Always Free** (no revenue limits, no thresholds)
- ✅ **Pro/Enterprise = Paid Software** (clear feature differentiation)
- ✅ **No OpenRAIL-M** (we don't distribute AI models, so it's not applicable)

### Q: Why did you remove OpenRAIL-M?

**A**: OpenRAIL-M is a license for **AI model weights** (neural network parameters). AutomatosX is **pure software** (TypeScript code, no models). Including OpenRAIL-M would:

- ❌ Confuse users ("Do I need to follow OpenRAIL-M?")
- ❌ Create legal uncertainty (OpenRAIL-M is untested for software)
- ❌ Serve no purpose (we have zero model weights to license)

**If we ever distribute models in the future**, we'll add appropriate model licensing. But currently, it's just software.

### Q: What happened to the $2M revenue threshold?

**A**: We removed it. The old licensing model said "if your company makes >$2M/year, you need a commercial license." This caused confusion:

- Users thought they **couldn't** use open source at scale
- Legal teams were uncertain about compliance
- It misaligned with our **open-core** strategy

**New model**:
- **Open Source Edition**: Free forever, any revenue
- **Pro/Enterprise Editions**: Paid software with extra features

If you need Pro/Enterprise features, you buy them. If not, use Open Source for free.

### Q: Can I still get support as an Open Source user?

**A**: Yes, via **community support**:
- GitHub Issues (bug reports, feature requests, questions)
- Email: support@defai.digital (community support, best-effort)

This is **best-effort** support (no SLA). For guaranteed response times, upgrade to Pro or Enterprise.

### Q: What if I want to build a competing product using AutomatosX?

**A**: You can fork the Open Source Edition under Apache 2.0 and build whatever you want. We don't restrict competitive use.

**However**:
- You can't use Pro/Enterprise editions to compete (those are proprietary software)
- You can't use our trademarks without permission
- You must comply with Apache 2.0 (attribution, license inclusion)

### Q: How do I purchase Pro or Enterprise?

**A**: Contact sales@defai.digital with:

1. Your use case (what are you building?)
2. Team size and expected usage
3. Support requirements (SLA, response time)
4. Compliance needs (if any)

We'll send you a custom quote and EULA for review.

### Q: Do you offer startup discounts?

**A**: Yes! Contact sales@defai.digital and mention you're a startup. We offer:
- Discounted pricing for early-stage startups
- Deferred payment options
- Startup partner programs

### Q: Can I try Pro/Enterprise before buying?

**A**: Yes, we offer **30-day trials** of Pro Edition. Contact sales@defai.digital to request access.

### Q: What's the refund policy?

**A**: Enterprise customers negotiate refund terms in their agreement.

For Pro Edition:
- **30-day money-back guarantee** if you're not satisfied
- Contact support@defai.digital within 30 days of purchase
